# FinalProject

### Team: Randall Richardson

This project will attempt to predict which Category a give product should be assigned to based on selected features from an existing catalog of items.  The intended purpose will be to allow the user to reclass items to a more granular set of categories for a very large catalog by manually reclassing a training set.
